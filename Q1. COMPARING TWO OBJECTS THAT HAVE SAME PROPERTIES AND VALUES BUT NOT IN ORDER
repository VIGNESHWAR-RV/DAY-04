   "COMPARING TWO OBJECTS THAT HAVE SAME PROPERTIES AND VALUES BUT NOT IN ORDER"
   
We cant directly equal such objects though they have same properties since they are not in order.
so inorder to check such objects , the best way is using nested loops to check if the property and its value matches
 and also the number of matches equals the number of properties available in both objects.
 
QUESTION :

A) let obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
B) let obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };
 
 
 ANSWER :
 
let obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
let obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };
let count = 0;
for(let i in obj1){
    for(let j in obj2){
        if(i===j && obj1.i===obj2.j) count++;
    }
}
(count=== Object.keys(obj1).length && count=== Object.keys(obj2).length) ?console.log('equal') :console.log('not equal');
